ซึ่งช่วยให้เราเข้าใจถึงสาเหตุที่ทำให้จำนวนผู้เสียชีวิตเพิ่มขึ้นในบางช่วงเวลาและลดลงในช่วงอื่น ๆ ตัวอย่างเช่น การเข้าถึงน้ำดื่มสะอาดได้มีส่วนสำคัญในการลดอัตราการเสียชีวิตจากโรคที่เกิดจากน้ำอย่างเช่น อหิวาตกโรคและอุจจาระร่วง\n","\n","นอกจากนี้ การพัฒนาวัคซีนในการรักษาโรคมาลาเรียในหลายประเทศก็มีผลอย่างมากต่อการลดอัตราการเสียชีวิตในกลุ่มเด็กและประชากรที่อาศัยอยู่ในพื้นที่ที่มีการแพร่ระบาดของโรคนี้ การระบาดของโรคที่เกิดจากน้ำและมาลาเรียนั้นสามารถควบคุมได้มากขึ้นด้วยการใช้วิธีการที่มีประสิทธิภาพ\n","\n","ในทางกลับกัน เหตุการณ์ทางธรรมชาติ เช่น แผ่นดินไหวและสึนามิในปี 2004 ทำให้จำนวนผู้เสียชีวิตเพิ่มขึ้นอย่างรวดเร็วในบางพื้นที่
